   <h1>Ridda Ali</h1>
    <p> A warm welcome to my webpage! I created this webpage specifically for the module "GEOG5995M - Programming for Social Science: Core Skills". <br>
      I am a PhD student at the University of Leeds. The main purpose of my research is to use agent-based modelling in order to simulate environmental, behavioural, economic and social determinants of obesity.
      <br><br> <!-- using break tag to start on a new line -->

      The first assignment required me to create an Agent-based Model (ABM) using the Python programming language. In the ABM sheeps are illustrated inside the environment and they perform various tasks such as moving and eating the grass (their size increases as they eat more grassï»¿until their store 
      (grass consumption) is greater than 1000) as shown in the gif below.
      Further details about this Agent-based Model (including the code) are available on my <a href="https://github.com/RiddaAli/ABM-1st-Coursework/tree/master/python"> GitHub repository (Agent-based Model)</a>.
	  <br><br>
      My website is available at RiddaAli.github.io and the code can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/RiddaAli/RiddaAli.github.io"> GitHub repository (website)</a>.
      
      <br><br> The following gif shows my Agent-based Model, which allows the user to specify the number of agents and the number of iterations:</p>
